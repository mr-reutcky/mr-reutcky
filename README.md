# Hi there! üëã I'm Samuel Reutcky  
Hi! I‚Äôm Samuel Reutcky, a software developer based in Manitoba, Canada. I‚Äôm currently enrolled in the Software Development program at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT), where I am learning to build and maintain web applications, work with databases, and create dynamic user experiences. My journey into programming has been exciting, and I love the challenge of solving complex problems with code.

I am a lifelong learner and always eager to pick up new skills. Right now, I‚Äôm honing my expertise in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, while diving deeper into back-end development with C#. My studies have also introduced me to modern tools and practices like version control with Git, responsive web design, and software development lifecycle management.

Collaboration is something I truly value. Whether I‚Äôm working solo or in a team, I enjoy brainstorming solutions and leveraging the unique perspectives of others to achieve great results. My approach to coding is practical and focused, and I enjoy breaking down big projects into manageable tasks.

Outside of coding, I am a proud pet owner‚ÄîI have a dog, a cat, and a gecko who keep me company while I work. I love finding ways to balance work and leisure, whether by going sailing, visiting the archery range to relieve stress, or spending a cozy evening at home.

As I continue my journey in software development, my goal is to grow my skill set and contribute to impactful projects. I‚Äôm excited about creating intuitive, accessible, and efficient software solutions that make life easier for users.

Feel free to check out my repositories and projects to see what I‚Äôve been working on. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!
